      <p>When it comes to building the best custom, high performing, industry-leading websites, there are various formats or technology stacks our developers utilize based on their preferences, project requirements, and the specific technologies they choose to work with. Here are a few of the popular full stack web design formats each of our in-house developers are experts in:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>LAMP Stack:</h3>
          <p>LAMP stands for Linux (operating system), Apache (web server), MySQL (database management system), and PHP (server-side scripting language). This format is widely used for building dynamic websites and applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>MEAN Stack:</h3>
          <p>MEAN stands for MongoDB (NoSQL database), Express.js (back-end web application framework), AngularJS (front-end JavaScript framework), and Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment). The MEAN stack is known for its flexibility and scalability, particularly for building real-time applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>MERN Stack:</h3>
          <p>Similar to MEAN, MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React (JavaScript front-end library), and Node.js. The MERN stack is a popular choice for building single-page applications and is well-suited for handling large amounts of data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Ruby on Rails:</h3>
          <p>Ruby on Rails, also known as RoR or Rails, is a full stack web application framework written in Ruby. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides developers with a convention-over-configuration approach, simplifying the development process.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Django:</h3>
          <p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the MVC architectural pattern. It comes with built-in features for authentication, database management, and URL routing, making it efficient for rapid development.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>ASP.NET:</h3>
          <p>ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft. It allows developers to build dynamic websites and applications using programming languages like C# or Visual Basic. ASP.NET provides a wide range of tools and libraries for full stack development.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Vue.js + Laravel:</h3>
          <p>This combination involves using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, with Laravel, a PHP web application framework. It provides a modern, efficient, and scalable approach to full stack web development.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Flask:</h3>
          <p>Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that emphasizes simplicity and minimalism. It allows developers to quickly build web applications with Python and integrates well with other libraries and tools.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>These are just a few examples of full stack web design formats we use here at Seismic Design. It's important to note that the choice of stack depends on the project requirements and the specific needs of the application or site being built. Our developers often mix and match technologies to create custom stacks that suit their preferences and the unique demands of our projects. When it is all said and done, when you work with Seismic, you are guaranteed the best, most cutting-edge, highest performing website that is available today.</p>
